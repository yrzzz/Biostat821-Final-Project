# Biostat821-Final-Project

BayesianNeuralNetwork is a simple PyTorch library for creating Bayesian Neural Network Layers. You can add uncertainty and gather the complexity cost of your model in a simple way that does not affect the interaction between your layers by using BayesianNeuralNetwork layers and utils. You can extend and improve this library by using our core weight sampler classes to add uncertainty to a larger scope of layers in a PyTorch-integrated manner.

## Function:
1. Write a documentation that breifly introduce Bayesian Neural Network
2. Introduce a bayesian layer that can be used as torch.nn.linear
3. Introduce a losses function called kl_divergency
4. Introduce a variation inference function that simplify the calculation
5. Write a demo to show users how to use this library
