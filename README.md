# Biostat821-Final-Project

## Target:
As the main deep learning framework, Pytorch does not have a library that enables users to introduce the Bayesian Neural Network into their models. The target of this project is to build a library that can help users easily integrate Bayesian Neural Networks with Pytorch.

## Function:
1. Write a documentation that breifly introduce Bayesian Neural Network
2. Introduce a bayesian layer that can be used as torch.nn.linear
3. Introduce a losses function called kl_divergency
4. Introduce a variation inference function that simplify the calculation
5. Write a demo to show users how to use this library
